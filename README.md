# Write-To-A-File-in-C
This is a simple implementation in C to create an array, receive array elements, sum and average the elements then write the output to a .txt file. This was basicly an academic tutorial session I had with a Computer Science undergraduate student.


# How to Run
Create a text.txt file in your local and reference the path accordingly depending on your coding environment.


You can build and run the file on Codeblocks. Alternatively, you can run it online

PS: If you use the online editor the file writing operation will take place on the local (server).
